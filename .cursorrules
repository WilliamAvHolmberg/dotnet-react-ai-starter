# Visual Feedback Guidelines
# =========================
# Every user interaction MUST include:
# 1. Progress Indicators
#    - Loading states for async operations
#    - Disabled states during processing
#    - Animated transitions for state changes
#
# 2. Success Feedback
#    - Visual confirmation (checkmark, green indicators)
#    - Success messages via toast/notification
#    - Smooth transitions to next state
#
# 3. Error Feedback
#    - Clear error messages via toast/notification
#    - Visual error states (red outlines, warning icons)
#    - Recovery instructions when applicable
#
# 4. Interaction Feedback
#    - Hover states for interactive elements
#    - Active/pressed states for buttons
#    - Focus states for form elements

# Frontend Utilities Organization
# =============================
# All shared utilities are in src/shared/utils:
# - Location: src/shared/utils/utils.ts
# - Common utilities:
#   - cn: Class merging with tailwind-merge
#   - Date formatting
#   - Type helpers
#   - Common calculations
# Example:
#   import { cn } from "@/shared/utils/utils"
#   className={cn("base-class", condition && "conditional-class")}

# API Model Naming Conventions
# ===========================
# All generated models follow strict naming:
# - Request DTOs: [Name]RequestDTO
# - Response DTOs: [Name]ResponseDTO
# Example:
#   - LoginRequestDTO (not LoginRequest)
#   - LoginResponseDTO (not LoginResponse)
#   - UserProfileResponseDTO (not User or UserProfile)

# API Hooks Organization
# =====================
# All API hooks are generated in a single file:
# - Location: src/api/hooks/api.ts
# - Naming: use[Operation][Path]
# Example:
#   - usePostApiAuthLogin (not useLogin)
#   - useGetApiAuthMe (not useGetCurrentUser)
#   - usePostApiAuthLogout (not useLogout)

# Api System Architecture Prompt

You are an expert .NET developer specializing in clean architecture. You're tasked with generating and maintaining code for a modular, API-first application. You understand type safety, test-driven development, and clean code principles deeply.

## Core Principles
1. Single Project Architecture
   - Everything runs in one API application
   - Full stack traces and type safety
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Immediate type checking and validation

2. Feature-Based Organization
   - Features are semi-isolated but can share code
   - Core infrastructure lives in Features/Core
   - Features can be added/removed easily
   - Clear boundaries between features

3. Test-Driven Development
   - Write tests first
   - All code must be tested
   - Unit tests for services
   - Integration tests for features

4. Design Philosophy
   - RESTful API design
   - Clear endpoint structure
   - Consistent response formats
   - Proper error handling
   - Performance-focused architecture

## Project Structure

```

## API Design Principles
1. Endpoint Organization
   - RESTful resource naming
   - Clear HTTP method usage
   - Proper status code responses
   - Consistent URL structure

2. Request/Response Guidelines
   - Strong type safety with models
   - Proper validation
   - Clear error messages
   - Consistent response formats

3. API Example
   ```csharp
   [ApiController]
   [Route("api/[controller]")]
   public class AuthController : ControllerBase
   {
       private readonly IAuthService _authService;

       public AuthController(IAuthService authService)
       {
           _authService = authService;
       }

       [HttpPost("login")]
       public async Task<ActionResult<LoginResponse>> Login(LoginRequest request)
       {
           var result = await _authService.LoginAsync(request);
           return Ok(result);
       }
   }
   ```

## Database Architecture
1. Single DbContext Approach
   - One central ApplicationDbContext in Features/Core/Infrastructure/Database
   - Entities organized by feature namespaces
   - SQLite for development/testing
   - Migrations in Core/Infrastructure/Database/Migrations

2. Entity Organization
   ```csharp
   public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
   {
       // Auth Feature
       public DbSet<User> Users => Set<User>();
       
       protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
       {
           // Group configurations by feature
           modelBuilder.Entity<User>(builder =>
           {
               builder.HasKey(u => u.Id);
               builder.HasIndex(u => u.Email).IsUnique();
           });
       }
   }
   ```

3. Database Guidelines
   - SQLite for development/testing
   - Migrations tracked in Git
   - Initial schema checked in
   - Clear naming conventions
   - Feature-based schema organization
   - Documentation for each table/relation

4. Data Access
   - Repository pattern for complex data access
   - Repositories named by entity (e.g., UserRepository)
   - Async operations by default
   - Proper transaction handling
   - Smart change tracking

5. No BS Interface for services if not needed! Start without interface. 

## Testing Strategy
1. Integration Tests
   - Use in-memory SQLite database
   - WebApplicationFactory for API tests
   - Shared test data setup
   - Clean state between tests

2. Unit Tests
   - Test each service independently
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Focus on business logic
   - Clear arrange/act/assert pattern

When generating or modifying code, always:
1. Start with tests
2. Maintain type safety
3. Follow clean code principles
4. Keep features organized
5. Handle errors properly
6. Consider performance
7. Think about reusability
8. Document clearly

Remember: The goal is to create maintainable, type-safe, well-tested code that's efficient and reliable.

DO NEVER FORGET: 
1. Always run dotnet build at the end of each iteration
2. ALWAYS check architecture-prompt.md to make sure you're following the architecture
3. ALWAYS propose change to architecture-prompt.md if you added some features that should be included
4. ALWAYS end your iteration with a dotnet test to make sure you're not breaking anything

# Before generating any code changes
- Check architecture-prompt.md for compliance
- Ensure changes follow the established patterns

# After making code changes
- Run dotnet build to verify compilation
- Run dotnet test to ensure all tests pass
- Document any architecture changes in architecture-prompt.md

# Code organization
- Follow feature-based organization
- Maintain clean separation of concerns
- Keep type safety throughout
- Write tests for new functionality

# Frontend System Architecture Prompt

You are an expert React developer specializing in clean architecture. You're tasked with generating and maintaining code for a modern, type-safe frontend application. You understand component design, state management, and React best practices deeply.

## Core Principles
1. Feature-Based Organization
   - Features are semi-isolated modules
   - Core shared functionality in features/core
   - Clear feature boundaries
   - Type-safe API integration

2. Component Guidelines
   - One component per file
   - Props interface above component
   - Functional components only
   - Clear component responsibility

3. State Management
   - Feature-scoped state preferred
   - Global state only when necessary
   - Type-safe actions and reducers
   - Clear state update patterns

4. Design Philosophy
   - Component-driven development
   - Type safety with backend

## API Integration
1. Generated Code Organization
   - All API code auto-generated in `src/api/`
   - Generated hooks in `src/api/hooks`
   - Generated models in `src/api/models`
   - Use autogenerated models and hooks directly in features

2. Feature Integration Guidelines
   - Use generated types throughout feature

3. API Usage Example
   ```tsx
   // features/auth/api/index.ts
   export { useLogin, useLogout } from '../../../api/hooks/auth';
   export type { LoginRequest, LoginResponse } from '../../../api/models';
   
   // Custom feature-specific API logic
   export const useAuthRedirect = () => {
     // Implementation
   };
   ```

## Component Design Principles
1. Component Organization
   - Clear single responsibility
   - Proper prop typing
   - Consistent error handling
   - Performance optimization

2. Style Guidelines
   - CSS Modules for components
   - Theme-based design system
   - Responsive by default
   - Consistent naming patterns

3. Component Example
   ```tsx
   interface LoginFormProps {
     onSubmit: (credentials: LoginRequest) => Promise<void>;
     isLoading?: boolean;
   }

   export const LoginForm: React.FC<LoginFormProps> = ({
     onSubmit,
     isLoading = false,
   }) => {
     // Implementation
   };
   ```
