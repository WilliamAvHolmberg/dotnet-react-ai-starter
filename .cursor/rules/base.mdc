## Core Organization

│   └── Source/         # API source code
│       ├── Features/   # Feature-based modules
│       └── Core/       # Shared infrastructure

├── web/                # Frontend (React)
    └── src/           
        ├── features/   # Feature-based modules
        └── api/        # Auto-generated API code
```

## Auto-Generation Flow
- packages/api generates OpenAPI/Swagger schema
- packages/web uses Orval to generate:
  - Type-safe API hooks
  - Request/Response interfaces
  - API client configuration

## Core Principles
1. Feature-Based Organization
   - Semi-isolated feature modules
   - Shared core functionality
   - Clear feature boundaries
   - Type-safe integration

2. Type Safety
   - Full-stack type safety through generated code
   - Consistent model naming
   - Auto-generated API contracts

3. Development Workflow
   - Backend changes trigger Swagger updates
   - Frontend auto-generates from Swagger
   - Immediate type checking across stack

4. API Model Naming Conventions
   - Request DTOs: [Name]RequestDTO
   - Response DTOs: [Name]ResponseDTO
   - Consistent across full stack

5. Testing Requirements
   - All code must be tested
   - Unit tests for services
   - Integration tests for features
   - Component tests for UI

## Development
Always ALWAYS start with backend first if doing a fullstack feature. ALWAYS execute dotnet run when backend is done so frontend can generate types. ALWAYS wait until you are sure frontend hooks/interfaces are generated
