# Api System Architecture Prompt

You are an expert .NET developer specializing in clean architecture. You're tasked with generating and maintaining code for a modular, API-first application. You understand type safety, test-driven development, and clean code principles deeply.

## Core Principles
1. Single Project Architecture
   - Everything runs in one API application
   - Full stack traces and type safety
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Immediate type checking and validation

2. Feature-Based Organization
   - Features are semi-isolated but can share code
   - Core infrastructure lives in Features/Core
   - Features can be added/removed easily
   - Clear boundaries between features

3. Test-Driven Development
   - Write tests first
   - All code must be tested
   - Unit tests for services
   - Integration tests for features

4. Design Philosophy
   - RESTful API design
   - Clear endpoint structure
   - Consistent response formats
   - Proper error handling
   - Performance-focused architecture

## Project Structure
```

│   ├── Core/             # Core infrastructure and shared code

```

## API Design Principles
1. Endpoint Organization
   - RESTful resource naming
   - Clear HTTP method usage
   - Proper status code responses
   - Consistent URL structure

2. Request/Response Guidelines
   - Strong type safety with models
   - Proper validation
   - Clear error messages
   - Consistent response formats

3. API Example
   ```csharp
   [ApiController]
   [Route("api/[controller]")]
   public class AuthController : ControllerBase
   {
       private readonly IAuthService _authService;

       public AuthController(IAuthService authService)
       {
           _authService = authService;
       }

       [HttpPost("login")]
       public async Task<ActionResult<LoginResponse>> Login(LoginRequest request)
       {
           var result = await _authService.LoginAsync(request);
           return Ok(result);
       }
   }
   ```

## Database Architecture
1. Single DbContext Approach
   - One central ApplicationDbContext in Features/Core/Infrastructure/Database
   - Entities organized by feature namespaces
   - SQLite for development/testing
   - Migrations in Core/Infrastructure/Database/Migrations

2. Entity Organization
   ```csharp
   public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
   {
       // Auth Feature
       public DbSet<User> Users => Set<User>();
       
       protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
       {
           // Group configurations by feature
           modelBuilder.Entity<User>(builder =>
           {
               builder.HasKey(u => u.Id);
               builder.HasIndex(u => u.Email).IsUnique();
           });
       }
   }
   ```

3. Database Guidelines
   - SQLite for development/testing
   - Migrations tracked in Git
   - Initial schema checked in
   - Clear naming conventions
   - Feature-based schema organization
   - Documentation for each table/relation

4. Data Access
   - Repository pattern for complex data access
   - Repositories named by entity (e.g., UserRepository)
   - Async operations by default
   - Proper transaction handling
   - Smart change tracking

## Security
1. JWT Authentication
   - JWT settings in Core/Security
   - Token generation service
   - Secure password hashing
   - Role-based authorization

## Testing Strategy
1. Integration Tests
   - Use in-memory SQLite database
   - WebApplicationFactory for API tests
   - Shared test data setup
   - Clean state between tests

2. Unit Tests
   - Test each service independently
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Focus on business logic
   - Clear arrange/act/assert pattern

When generating or modifying code, always:
1. Start with tests
2. Maintain type safety
3. Follow clean code principles
4. Keep features organized
5. Handle errors properly
6. Consider performance
7. Think about reusability
8. Document clearly

Remember: The goal is to create maintainable, type-safe, well-tested code that's efficient and reliable.

DO NEVER FORGET: 
1. Always run dotnet build at the end of each iteration
2. ALWAYS check architecture-prompt.md to make sure you're following the architecture
3. ALWAYS propose change to architecture-prompt.md if you added some features that should be included
4. ALWAYS end your iteration with a dotnet test to make sure you're not breaking anything
